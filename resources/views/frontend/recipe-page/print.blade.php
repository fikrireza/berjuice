<p>For Chocolate Glaze:</p>
<p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</p>
<p>1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder </p>
<p>3 cups all-purpose flour </p>
<p>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar </p>
<p>2 teaspoons baking soda </p>
<p>1 teaspoon salt </p>
<p>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon </p>
<p>2 cups freshly squeezed orange juice, plus 2 tablespoons finely grated zest</p>
<p>3/4 cup mayonnaise </p>
<p>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar </p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </p>
<h2>Directions:</h2>
<p>Special equipment: a Bundt pan

<p>For the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Mix together the softened butter and 1 tablespoon of the cocoa to make a thick paste. Use this paste to paint the inside of the Bundt pan. Set aside.</p>

<p>In an electric mixer, combine the flour, granulated sugar, baking soda, salt, cinnamon and remaining 1/2 cup cocoa and mix until blended. Add the orange juice, mayonnaise, vinegar and vanilla and mix until just combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Fold in the orange zest. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, 45 minutes. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto a cooling rack to cool completely.</p>

<p>For the chocolate glaze: Mix the confectioners' sugar and cocoa together. Whisk in the orange juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches a good consistency to drizzle. Drizzle the glaze over the cake.</p>
